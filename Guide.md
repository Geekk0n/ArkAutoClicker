# ArkAutoClicker
An easy Script to execute an auto-clicker providing hotkeys for specific numbers of clicks as well as a regular auto-click feature making it more convenient to level up your Dinos to almost max stat.

**This script uses AutoHotKey so you have to install it before using the script. (https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)**
After installing AutoHotKey just run the script and have fun.

**Features**
* **Ctrl + m**:Perform 250 clicks so there is a buffer of 5 levels until max
* **Ctrl + 1**:Perform 100 clicks
* **Ctrl + 5**:Perform 50 clicks
* **Ctrl + Alt + LMouse**:Perform unlimited auto-clicker (Be careful this is incredibly fast so you won't be able to control it)
* *All the clicks are performed at the current mouse location*

If you have suggestions to other features or want to remap the hotkeys you can either do it by editing the script (it's very simple) or tweet me @Geekk0n
Have fun
